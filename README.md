# Procedural Weapon Animation System  
**Animate your weapon with ease!**

The **Procedural Weapon Animation System** is a lightweight and easy-to-use Unity template for animating weapons using procedural motion. It uses a *physics-based spring system* to simulate smooth, realistic weapon movement—no need for keyframe animations!

## Getting Started

1. Create a new `GameObject` in your Unity scene.
2. Attach the `SpringSystem` and `SpringManager` scripts to the GameObject.
3. In the **Inspector**, assign the **Weapon Root** (the weapon’s `Transform`) to the Spring System.
